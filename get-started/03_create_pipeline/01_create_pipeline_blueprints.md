Your [workflow was refactored](https://github.com/FilippoBovo/production-data-science/tree/master/tutorial/d-refactor#refactoring-the-notebook). You will focus on creating a pipeline with `/03_create_pipeline/data_processing.py`{{open}}.

You will create a pipeline template for this pipeline using: `kedro pipeline create "data_processing"`{{execute}}.

The `kedro pipeline create` command creates templates for you which are listed in the terminal.
