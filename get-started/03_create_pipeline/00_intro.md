Python functions are the building blocks of a Kedro pipeline. This workflow assumes you have prototyped your approach in a Jupyter notebook or Python script and have [refactored your code](https://github.com/FilippoBovo/production-data-science/tree/master/tutorial/d-refactor#refactoring-the-notebook).

You will learn how to: 
 - Create a pipeline template
 - Assemble a pipeline
 
This exercise relies on a modification of [Flippo Bovo's _Production Data Science_ notes](https://github.com/FilippoBovo/production-data-science).
