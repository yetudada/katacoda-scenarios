Specifying a projectâ€™s dependencies in Kedro makes it easier for others to run your project; it avoids version conflicts by use of the same Python packages.

The generic project template bundles some typical dependencies, in `get-started/src/requirements.txt`{{open}}.

To install the project-specific dependencies, navigate to the root directory of the project and run: `kedro install
`{{execute}}
