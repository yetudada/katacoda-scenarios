Once you have [installed Kedro](./02_install.md), you can create a new, empty project by answering a series of questions.

Create a new project in your current working directory with: `kedro new`{{execute}}

You will be asked to enter each of the following variables in turn. Once you have entered text for the first option (the project's name), you will be offered a default choice for the other options:

 - **Project name:** A human-readable name for your new project e.g. `Get Started`{{execute}}
 - **Repo name:** A name for the folder that holds your project e.g. `get-started`{{execute}}
 - **Python package:** A name for the Python package name in your project (short, all-lowercase) e.g.`get_started`{{execute}}
 
The output lists the directory in which to find the project and enter the project folder: `cd get-started`{{execute}}

Have a look at your project template with: `ls .`{{execute}}
